# TitanicSurvival-NeuralNetwork-


The aim of the project is to make a prediction on titanic survivors. 
The prediction is made with a Neural Network on Keras Backend.
The steps of the algorithm are:
-preprocessing data
-feature selection
-Tuning of parameter with grid search
  parameter:
    -number of layer
    -number of neuron
    -
