# TitanicSurvival-NeuralNetwork

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Getting Started

If you want to start the project with a notebook you have to use titanic.ipynb.

### Prerequisites


```
-python 3.6

-pip
```

### Work

The prediction is made with a Neural Network on Keras Backend. The steps of the algorithm are: 
-preprocessing data (replace null value with mean or frequency, transformation of categorical features, drop column, standardization
-feature selection (PCA)
-Tuning of parameter with grid search parameter(number of layers,number of neurons,batch size, epochs,dropout,optimizer.
